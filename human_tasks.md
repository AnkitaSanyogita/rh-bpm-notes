Human Tasks
===========

Syntax to add variables in **subject** or **description**

E.g.
Escalation for Artwork Processing #{defaultDataInput}


Users are listed in the following file:

    ~/EAP-6.4.0/standalone/configuration/application-users.properties

Roles are defined in the following file:

    ~/EAP-6.4.0/standalone/configuration/application-roles.properties


**TODO**
userinfo.conf ....



## Special Roles

The user `Administrator` and all users in the group `Administrators`, can see and manage all the task. (This name can be configure through these system properties: `org.jbpm.ht.admin.user`, `org.jbpm.ht.admin.group`.

In order to define a specific administration group for a task, the developer has to define either `BusinessAdministratorId` or `BusinessAdministratorGroupId` as task input parameter.

If a task define the `ExcludedOwnerId`, this user is removed by the potential owner list.

## 4 eye principle

And why not to rely on potential owners and excluded owners that come with WS-HT spec that we do have support for? 

the first task that is completed returns `ActorId` data output that represents the actual onwer who completed the task, then map this to variable and use on next task as excluded owner (via data input mapping, parameter name: `ExcludedOwnerId`) so when you query for tasks (via task service queries that take into consideration excluded owners) you won’t see that task and thus won’t be able to work on it.

It cannot implemented to a couple of issues.
